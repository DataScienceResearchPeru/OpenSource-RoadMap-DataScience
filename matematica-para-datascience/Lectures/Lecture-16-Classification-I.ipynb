    "In last few lectures we have learned the linear regression, where we explore the possibility of using a linear function (or higher degree polynomials) to represent the relation of the features in the samples (aka labels, $x$ values, or training data `X_train`) to a target value ($y$ values `y_train`), so that we can predict the target value $y$ (`y_pred` obtained by the model) based on testing data `X_test`.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, linear regression is not appropriate in the case of a qualitative target value.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Classification\n",
    "Today, we will learn how to predict a discrete label such as \n",
    "* predicting whether a grid of pixel intensities represents a \"0\" digit or a \"1\" digit;\n",
    "* predicting whether tomorrow will have rain based on previous days' data.\n",
    "* predicting whether a wine is good or mediocre based on its chemical components' data.\n",
